## To use/update, download the Delta_Set1.xml file and place it in Cockatrice\data\customsets

Deck files are in the deck files folder if you would like to grab some. If you have any you would like to submit just dm or ping @skifreak on discord.

Note: When cards are updated, you will need to go to Cockatrice -> Card Sources -> Delete Downloaded Images in the menus for them to refresh on your client.

If you have old image files for this set from back before this repo was created, you may need to remove them from Cockatrice\data\pics\CUSTOM
